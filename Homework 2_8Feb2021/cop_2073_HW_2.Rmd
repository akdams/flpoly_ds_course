# Problem 1 (30 points

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you are asked to modify the `flpoly_student.md` file you worked during class, and format it using the **markdown** tools discussed in class. You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using for the headers of the table: 

- Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
- Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
- Name: in italics (such as _Introduction to Data Science_)
- Credits (such as 3)

a. Make sure your GitHub repo (`flpoly_ds_course/`) shows the results of your updated file (remember to use the commands `git add .` , `git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"`, and `git push`) 

b. Include a link to your GitHub repo in this document.

- The link to my document is [here](https://github.com/akdams/flpoly_ds_course/blob/main/flpoly_student.md)

c. Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo, add the screenshot file to the repo, and include it in this document (review how to insert a picture using markdown)

# Problem 2 (30 points)

_For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **3 concepts** you have learned about so far this semester, for at least 2 of the courses you are currently taking. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Include a link to information about at least one of the concept you listed (for example a link to the Wikipedia page about that concept/topics)_

## Intro to Operations Reasearch:
- [Break Even Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakevenanalysis.asp#:~:text=Break%2Deven%20analysis%20tells%20you,corporate%20budgeting%20for%20various%20projects.)
- Objective Functions with their relation to decision variables and constraints. 
- Multiple Optimal Solutions, Infeasible Solutions, and Inifine Solutions

## Intro to Data Science:
- [Git Commands](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html) and how to operate Github.
- Basic R functions like paste, nchr, and seq, and how to install R packages.
- Varying data types and simple means on how to use them.

# Problem 3 (40 points)

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)

(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains your preferred name.
```{r}
my_name <- "Austin Adams"
print(my_name)
```

(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.
```{r}
name_length <- nchar(my_name)
paste("The number of letters in the name,", my_name, "is", name_length)
```

(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. 
```{r}
e <-  exp(1)
ifelse(e^pi > pi^e, "e^pi is bigger than pi^e", "pi^e is bigger than e^pi ") # this statement uses a test function, if yes, states it is bigger. 
# If it is not bigger, then it swaps the varaibles to indicate the other is bigger
```

(d) Define a function called `add_tree` that takes a single argument and returns a value 3 times larger than the input.
```{r}
add_tree <- function(y)
  {
  return(y*3) # returns the arguement of y * 3 to make it 3X as large
  } 
```

(e) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 10 to 49. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.
```{r}
v <- 10:49
paste("The length of this vector is:", length(v))
```


(f) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.
```{r}
seq(-5,10, by = 0.5)
```
