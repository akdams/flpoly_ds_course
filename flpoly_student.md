**Hobbies:**

I am passionate about: 

- All varying types of sports, but especially football, hockey, and golf. Personally, I only play golf but am a realtively new beginner. My favorite golfer is [Rickie Fowler] (https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.32102.rickie-fowler.html)

- Investing and following the stock market. I really enjoy it and would love to start my own company in teaching those below 21 years old what it means to invest wisely and be financially literate.

- Spaceflight and rocket launches. Some of the launch photographers I support, know, and follow are shown in [this website] (https://www.johnkrausphotos.com/) and [this wesbite](https://www.tmahlmann.com/)
